## ðŸ§ª Unit Testing
The app includes unit tests for key components to ensure that each function works as expected and provides a reliable experience. Using Jest and React Testing Library, we've tested the following components:

- **AddTransaction**: Verifies that new transactions are added correctly and prevents invalid data submission.
- **Balance**: Confirms the balance display based on user transactions.
- **IncomeExpenses**: Checks that income and expense totals are calculated and displayed accurately.
- **Transaction**: Ensures each transaction displays correctly and can be deleted.
- **TransactionList**: Validates that all transactions are rendered as expected.
- **Header**: Simple check to ensure the app header displays as intended.

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling

The app is styled using a custom CSS file located at \`src/App.css\`. Key styles include:

- **Container**: Centered container with a fixed width.
- **Buttons**: Styled buttons for adding transactions and deleting items.
- **Lists**: Styled lists for displaying income and expenses.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

We have several ideas for future improvements to make this app even better:

- **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts and securely log in to access their personal expense data.
- **Data Visualization**: Implement charts and graphs to provide visual insights into spending habits and trends.
- **Recurring Transactions**: Enable users to set up recurring transactions for regular expenses like rent, subscriptions, etc.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile version of the app for both iOS and Android platforms.
- **Expense Categories**: Allow users to categorize their expenses for better organization and analysis.
- **Budget Alerts**: Send notifications or alerts when users are close to exceeding their budget limits.
